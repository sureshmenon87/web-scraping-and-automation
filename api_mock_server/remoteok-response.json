Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money, USDe, alongside a globally accessible dollar savings asset, sUSDe.</p><p><br></p><p>Our core mission is to provide truly crypto-native financial solutions that are globally accessible and bridge the gap between TradFi and the digital asset economy. We believe in transparency, efficiency, and empowering both individuals and institutions with greater control over their assets.</p><p><br></p><p><b style=\"font-size: 18px\">What we are Doing:</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Ethena Labs is actively building and deploying a suite of groundbreaking products designed to address key challenges and unlock new opportunities within the digital finance landscape.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Our flagship product, </span><b style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">USDe</b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">, is a synthetic dollar backed by digital assets, and takes the novel approach of using a delta-neutral hedging strategy to maintain its peg. This provides a truly scalable and censorship-resistant digital dollar.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Building upon USDe, we offer </span><b style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">sUSDe</b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">. sUSDe provides crypto-native rewards generated from funding rates in derivatives markets, offering an alternative to existing products tethered to the traditional financial system.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">Furthermore, we are actively developing solutions to facilitate institutional adoption of digital assets.
